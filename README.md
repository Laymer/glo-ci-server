# Glo CI Server

This is the backend for [Glo CI](https://github.com/kingjan1999/glo-ci). It is based on the great [express-rest-es2017-boilerplate](https://github.com/danielfsousa/express-rest-es2017-boilerplate), which is the reason why this project is sometimes called `boilerplate-api` (I was too lazy to replace it...)
